Shmames v3 Design
---

Slash-command and Interaction Hook only
Uses modals and buttons where possible
Store data in MongoDB
Pro features, admin controls, serial numbers

---

Use serial numbers to "unlock" commands not included in the global command list (track servers that have it, and then issue a
slash command update with varying payloads)

---

Dev steps:
- Shmames commands, services, utilities
- Clean up, comment core code
- Display / Rendering / Updating of Embed extension?
    - Instead of a core bot feature, add a set of tools to draw up and refresh messages.
    - This can also feature a modal builder.
    - Still need to pass back language to implementing class. Need to standardize message keys?
