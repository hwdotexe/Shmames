Shmames v3 Design
---

Slash-command and Interaction Hook only
Uses modals and buttons where possible
Store data in MongoDB
Pro features, admin controls, serial numbers

---

Use serial numbers to "unlock" commands not included in the global command list (track servers that have it, and then issue a
slash command update with varying payloads)

---

Dev steps:
- Shmames commands, services, utilities
- Clean up, comment core code
- Display / Rendering / Updating of Embed extension?
    - Instead of a core bot feature, add a set of tools to draw up and refresh messages.
    - This can also feature a modal builder.
    - Still need to pass back language to implementing class. Need to standardize message keys?

Ideas:
- /roll no parameters embed with buttons that append rolls to the embed per user


Corvus features:
x- Upload images/files to a reply
x- Thumbnails
x- Modals
- Paginated replies (use an internal response ID to perform accurate caching)
x- Buttons & callbacks
x- Maybe a static method to call that accepts an Execution object to process the reply?
x- Eliminate Command base class response method
*- Ability to add a thread/task/Timer that updates the response
    > Can be implemented by the base


Pagination:
- If using Buttons, the embed needs to persist a reference to the entire message and which page is currently being viewed.
    > This is not possible within Discord itself. This bot will need to remember each message, which isn't feasible at scale.
    > We can temporarily cache this data in memory, and then remove the buttons when cache expires?
        - Potential issues during an unexpected shutdown, with no way to recover.
- Old fashioned way works fine, just a bit redundant
