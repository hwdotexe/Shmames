DEV TODO:
- Get mongodb working
- LanguageService implementation
- Listeners implementation
- Remove command code that is no longer needed
    - Regex pattern building
    - Parameter validation
- Server Settings?


Use serial numbers to "unlock" commands not included in the global command list (track servers that have it, and then issue a
slash command update with varying payloads)
