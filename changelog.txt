Adjustments

Fixes
- Tally emote reactions were not adjusting tallies.
- Replies do not ping the author by default for most commands.

Removals
- Random responses can no longer send a random gif using the [gif] prefix. This was removed due to technical limitations with embedding GIFs into a message.

Technical
- Updated libraries.
- Changed versioning format
- Refactored command processing to improve reliability and performance.
- Commands now inherit from a Class instead of an Interface, allowing for more shared logic.
- Brains now save the IDs for roles, emotes, and channels, instead of the names for each.
- Regex generation is now separated into more steps for easier debugging and improved command matching.
- Hangman code was cleaned up and its algorithms improved.
- Added a CacheService to cache data instead of retrieving it multiple times in succession.
  - Caching is determined by the server, channel, and user running the command. Cached data is saved only for a short time before being deleted.
  - This change should speed up the use of commands that are often run multiple times, such as lists.
