- Success, Error response in parent so we don't have to duplicate Error enum?


- Language combine enum and default values?
- Messages larger than the character maximum for fields/description (see Storytime)
  - Alternatively: Family emotes, split a large embed at the reply level

- Command stats public?

- Delete generic success messages after a period of time

PaginationService paginationID to cache data that may be called multiple times
-- server/user/time? channel? command?


Not happy with:
- ForumWeapon
  - Very messy
  - Some repeated code in Search and List
- Pagination caching
  - All commands currently re-run logic to build a page. We should cache all data and serve the pages as requested.
- Returning null causes InteractionHook to stall
  - Null should cause a default acknowledgement to fire
  - Alternatively, can we acknowledge the command later in the process?
- Poll
  - Maybe we should send a Please Wait message before the poll message is built.
