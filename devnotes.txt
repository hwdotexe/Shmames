Join/upgrade message
    - Redo settings
    - Link to gist with changelog

Languages
    - Fix messages not deserializing correctly. Gson -> LinkedHashMap throws an error when keys are removed because null is a duplicate key
    - Consolidate errors & messages if any are too similar
    - Rename lang messages
    - Language combine enum and default values?

More permissions
  - Deleting lists
  - Managing triggers

Modals (slash command only)
  - Reports
  - May require commands to be slash-only as a result

Code Organization
    - Success, Error response in parent so we don't have to duplicate Error enum?
    - Timer interaction hook: reply to bot's message instead of hook, see if that pings the user.
    - Messages larger than the character maximum for fields/description (see Storytime)
        - Alternatively: mirror Family emotes; split a large embed at the reply level
    - PaginationService paginationID to cache data that may be called multiple times
        - server/user/time? channel? command?

Functionality movement
    - Family view music playlists
    - Command stats public?
    - Delete generic success messages after a period of time
      - React
      - Simon Says
      - Hangman start
      - Music pause/resume

Not happy with:
- ForumWeapon
  - Very messy
  - Some repeated code in Search and List
- Pagination caching
  - All commands currently re-run logic to build a page. We should cache all data and serve the pages as requested.
- Returning null causes InteractionHook to stall
  - Null should cause a default acknowledgement to fire
  - Alternatively, can we acknowledge the command later in the process?
- Poll
  - Maybe we should send a Please Wait message before the poll message is built.
- Music
  - Messy
