=== FAMILY BREAKDOWN (lol) ===
A Family is a connection between two or more servers. A Family is owned by one individual, who alone can generate a
Family Join Code.

To add a server to a Family, the user first creates a code on a server that's already a member of the Family. Then, that
code can be shared with another server to add it to the group.

Only server Administrators can join a server to a Family, but they don't need to be the Family owner, once a Code has been
created. Any Administrator can remove the server from a Family at will.

Codes are single-use only, and expire when used, or when a join does not complete (to avoid other users sniping).
