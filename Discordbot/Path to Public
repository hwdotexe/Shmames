        [ Command to link/view/unlink ]
    - Donate command
    [DONE] - Poll user permissions
    - Server link permissions

REMOVE:
    [DONE] - Source, Music, Report commands; Dev privileged intents
CHANGE:
    - Use a database for storage, so all shards can be created equal
    - FWs and Echo emotes should be Family-only
        [ when using a Family, james will search all servers in that family after searching the current server ]
    - Move FWs to a server-specific brain
    [DONE] - Verify limits of API keys // WA-2000, Tenor-?
    - Rename Ronald to Hate, and convert old data
