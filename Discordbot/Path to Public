== James' Path to Public ==

FIX:
    [DONE] - Fwlist and Emote Stats break when sending a long message
ADD:
    - reset to factory command
    - increase help desc
    [DONE] - use `` when listing responses so the link doesn't generate a preview
    [DONE] - redo the help layout, I still hate it
    [DONE] - Hangman separate dicts with ",", exclude them by starting it with "!"
    - Switch to csv with dynamic library names
    - Support sharding
    [DONE] - Server Families
        [ Admins can link servers together with a 1-time GUID sent via PM ]
        [ Command to link/view/unlink ]
    - Donate command
    [DONE] - Poll user permissions
    [DONE] - Server link permissions
    [DONE] - Emote stat reset permissions
    [DONE] - Welcome message directing them to Modify command
    [DONE] - Timer persistence
    [DONE] - If a family has 0 servers, delete the family
REMOVE:
    [DONE] - Source, Music, Report commands; Dev privileged intents
    [DONE] - FW migration code
    [DONE] - Motherbrain FW data
CHANGE:
    - Listing stuff is weak (triggers, tallies, etc. - use Util or make a new one)
    - Add a way to see trigger/response types?
    - Move all error messages out to Errors.java
    [DONE] - Automatically set defaults when first joining (modify)
    [DONE] - React triggers need to be family-only!
    - Use a database for storage, so all shards can be created equal
    [DONE] - FWs and Echo emotes should be Family-only
        [ when using a Family, james will search all servers in that family after searching the current server ]
    [DONE] - Move FWs to a server-specific brain
    [DONE] - Verify limits of API keys // WA-2000, Tenor-?
    [DONE] - Rename Ronald to Hate, and convert old data
    [DONE] - Don't save to disk when adding/removing tallies and triggers and things.

+ Can the bot write to the audit log when someone uses the Echo command?
+ Does PinThat need a permission?


== THE DATABASE UPDATE ==
Need:   Database for persistence
        Cache API (makes DB ops, otherwise caches Brain files)

        Shmames shards will call API when accessing Shmames.getBrains().getBrain(...)

        (maybe)
