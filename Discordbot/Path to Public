== James' Path to Public ==

FIX:
    [DONE] - Fwlist and Emote Stats break when sending a long message
ADD:
    - Support sharding
    - Server Families
        [ Admins can link servers together with a 1-time GUID sent via PM ]
        [ Command to link/view/unlink ]
    - Donate command
    - Poll user permissions
    - Server link permissions
REMOVE:
    [DONE] - Source, Music, Report commands; Dev privileged intents
CHANGE:
    - Use a database for storage, so all shards can be created equal
    - FWs and Echo emotes should be Family-only
        [ when using a Family, james will search all servers in that family after searching the current server ]
    - Move FWs to a server-specific brain
    - Verify limits of API keys
    - Rename Ronald to Hate, and convert old data

+ Can the bot write to the audit log when someone uses the Echo command?
